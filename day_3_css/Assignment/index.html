      Ducks are also called 'waterfowl' because they are normally found in
      places where there is water like ponds, streams, and rivers.
    </p>
    <p class="duckfacts">
      Ducks can live up to 20 years, depending on the species and if well cared
      for.
    </p>
    <p class="duckfacts">
      The production of eggs is affected by daylight. When there is more
      daylight, the ducks will lay more eggs. To prevent this from happening,
      farmers use artificial lighting so that the ducks have about 17 hours of
      light a day to produce eggs efficiently.
