          <p>
            The Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) is Webb's primary imager that will
            cover the infrared wavelength range 0.6 to 5 microns. NIRCam will
            detect light from: the earliest stars and galaxies in the process of
            formation, the population of stars in nearby galaxies, as well as
            young stars in the Milky Way and Kuiper Belt objects. NIRCam is
            equipped with coronagraphs, instruments that allow astronomers to
            take pictures of very faint objects around a central bright object,
            like stellar systems. NIRCam's coronagraphs work by blocking a
            brighter object's light, making it possible to view the dimmer
            object nearby - just like shielding the sun from your eyes with an
            upraised hand can allow you to focus on the view in front of you.
            With the coronagraphs, astronomers hope to determine the
            characteristics of planets orbiting nearby stars.

          <p>
            The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) has both a camera and a
            spectrograph that sees light in the mid-infrared region of the
            electromagnetic spectrum, with wavelengths that are longer than our
            eyes see. MIRI covers the wavelength range of 5 to 28 microns. Its
            sensitive detectors will allow it to see the redshifted light of
            distant galaxies, newly forming stars, and faintly visible comets as
            well as objects in the Kuiper Belt. MIRI's camera will provide
            wide-field, broadband imaging that will continue the breathtaking
            astrophotography that has made Hubble so universally admired. The
            spectrograph will enable medium-resolution spectroscopy, providing
            new physical details of the distant objects it will observe.

            Near InfraRed Spectrograph

          </h4>

          <p class="longer-p">
            The Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec) will operate over a
            wavelength range of 0.6 to 5 microns. A spectrograph (also sometimes
            called a spectrometer) is used to disperse light from an object into
            a spectrum. Analyzing the spectrum of an object can tell us about
            its physical properties, including temperature, mass, and chemical
            composition. The atoms and molecules in the object actually imprint
            lines on its spectrum that uniquely fingerprint each chemical
            element present and can reveal a wealth of information about
            physical conditions in the object. Spectroscopy and spectrometry
            (the sciences of interpreting these lines) are among the sharpest
            tools in the shed for exploring the cosmos.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of the objects that the Webb will study, such as the first
            galaxies to form after the Big Bang, are so faint, that the Webb's
            giant mirror must stare at them for hundreds of hours in order to
            collect enough light to form a spectrum. In order to study thousands
            of galaxies during its 5 year mission, the NIRSpec is designed to
            observe 100 objects simultaneously. The NIRSpec will be the first
            spectrograph in space that has this remarkable multi-object
            capability. To make it possible, Goddard scientists and engineers
            had to invent a new technology microshutter system to control how
            light enters the NIRSpec.

            The Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS) allows Webb to point precisely, so
            that it can obtain high-quality images. The Near Infrared Imager and
            Slitless Spectrograph part of the FGS/NIRISS will be used to
            investigate the following science objectives: first light detection,
            exoplanet detection and characterization, and exoplanet transit
            spectroscopy.
          </p>
          <p>
            FGS/NIRISS has a wavelength range of 0.8 to 5.0 microns, and is a
            specialized instrument with three main modes, each of which
            addresses a separate wavelength range. FGS is a "guider," which
            helps point the telescope.

          Webb will tell us more about the atmospheres of extrasolar planets,
          and perhaps even find the building blocks of life elsewhere in the
          universe. In addition to other planetary systems, Webb will also study
          objects within our own Solar System.
